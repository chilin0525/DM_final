# Data Mining Final HW

* I update some code base on [recommenders DKN notebook](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_content_based_filtering/dkn_deep_dive.ipynb), so you need to install package first:
    ```
    $ pip install recommenders
    ```
* download dataset given from TA, file structure should be like this:
    ```
    tree -L 1                                                     
    .
